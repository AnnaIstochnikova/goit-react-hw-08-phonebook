# GoIt-react-hw-08-phonebook

## Description

This is an upgraded phonebook application developed using React and enhanced by integrating Redux Toolkit for efficient state management. Unlike the previous version that utilized MockAPI, this iteration leverages a dedicated backend service. For this task, an existing backend is available. This backend supports all essential contact operations along with user registration, login functionality, and user updates utilizing JWT authentication.
